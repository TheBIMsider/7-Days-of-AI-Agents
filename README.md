A place to store my projects from **#7DaysofAIAgents** from [100 School](https://www.100school.com/)

This repository is for my adventures with the [7 Days of AI Agents Challenge](https://www.100school.com/atomic-challenges/7daysofaiagents)

What is 7 Days of AI Agents, you ask? It's an opportunity Learn to build AI agents in 7 days with daily bitesized lessons. Free, fun and effective 30 minute bitesized lessons delivered daily to guide your AI journey.
